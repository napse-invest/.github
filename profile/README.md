***" The good sailor doesn't distract himself in calm weather, but in storms. "***

This quote has been our guiding principle in building the Napse ecosystem
The customizable bot technologies we've built are designed to produce a steady return, whether the market rises or falls.
Napse takes advantage of a falling market, unlike other trading bots which will plunge along with the market.
